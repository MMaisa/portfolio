OVERVIEW

I have analyzed bank customer churn using SQL queries seen in bank_churn.sql on an SQLite database. The data set included customer information like age, gender, account details, country, income details and churn rate. The goal is to analyze the churn rate by different factors and offer recommendations according to the insights. 

KEY INSIGHTS

- Age group with the highest churn rate: 41-55 years (10,57%).
- Country with the highest churn rate: Germany (32,44%).
    - Indicating a need to prioritize changes in strategies in Germany's market.
- Customers with 3 or more products had a very high churn rate (82,7-100%).
    - This could indicate product dissatisfaction or bad sales strategies.
- Active customers have a much higher churn rate (26,85%) vs active members (14,27%).
    - Indicating a possibility to implement engagement strategies.
